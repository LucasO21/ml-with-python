# ML With Python

This repo contains notebooks of learning projects for implementing machine learning in python.

__Ames Housing Prediction -__ This is my first data science project using python. The goal of this project was to explore some feature selection techniques as well as focus on implementation in python using scikit-learn, as well as the [feature engine](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/1.3.x/) python package.

* Dataset - For this project, I used the [ames dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from kaggle. The reason I chose this dataset was that it has a good combination of numeric and categorical features, 82 features in total. This gave me an opportunity to explore various feature selection, feature encoding and feature transformation methods.
